## Technical Debt Reduction

The following areas represent significant technical debt that should be addressed:

1. **Placeholder components** - Several critical components have placeholder implementations
2. **Inconsistent naming conventions** - Mixed kebab-case and PascalCase usage
3. **Duplicate logic** - Wizard state management spread across multiple files
4. **Missing accessibility features** - Particularly focus management
5. **Inconsistent error handling** - Various patterns across the application

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

These recommendations offer significant improvements with minimal development effort:

1. **Complete error message component** - Improves error visibility with low implementation effort
2. **Standardize component naming** - Improves codebase predictability with simple renaming
3. **Add haptic feedback** - Enhances mobile experience with minimal code
4. **Add visual indicators for date ranges** - Prevents user confusion with simple UI changes
5. **Add proper ARIA attributes** - Greatly improves accessibility with small code changes

## Implementation Approach

When addressing these recommendations, consider the following approach:

1. Start with critical issues that affect security and data integrity
2. Address high-impact, low-effort items for quick improvements
3. Tackle technical debt systematically to improve maintainability
4. Complete placeholder implementations to ensure full functionality
5. Enhance mobile and accessibility features for better user experience

By prioritizing these recommendations according to severity and effort required, you can systematically improve the Simple Tracker application while balancing immediate needs with long-term code health.
