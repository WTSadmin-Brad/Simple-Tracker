# Simple Tracker - High-Level Action Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a strategic approach to address the findings identified in the code review of the Simple Tracker application. As a solo developer, this plan provides a structured framework to prioritize efforts and systematically improve the application's quality, functionality, and user experience.

## Implementation Approach

As a solo developer, the approach focuses on:

1. **Priority-based implementation**: Addressing critical issues first before moving to lower priorities
2. **Iterative development**: Completing full features before moving to the next to maintain a functional application
3. **Balanced workload**: Alternating between complex and simpler tasks to maintain momentum
4. **Systematic technical debt reduction**: Incorporating debt reduction into each development cycle
5. **Testing focus**: Adding tests for each component as they are developed or modified
