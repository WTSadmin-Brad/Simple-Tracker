- **Finding**: While some components like `TextField.client.tsx` implement proper accessibility attributes (aria-invalid, aria-describedby), others lack these essential attributes. Focus management for modals and wizard steps is inconsistently implemented.
- **Impact**: Makes parts of the application less accessible to users with disabilities, potentially violating WCAG 2.2 compliance requirements.
- **Fix**: Ensure all interactive components have proper ARIA attributes, implement focus management for modals and wizard steps, and add keyboard navigation support.

### ðŸŸ¡ Redundant Code in Multiple Locations

- **Finding**: The wizard state management is spread across multiple files with some duplication of logic. Category definitions appear in both the `CategoriesStep.client.tsx` component and the wizard store.
- **Impact**: Makes it harder to maintain and extend functionality, as changes need to be made in multiple places.
- **Fix**: Consolidate duplicated logic into shared utilities or hooks, and maintain single sources of truth for constants and configurations.

### ðŸŸ¡ State Management Inefficiencies

- **Finding**: Some components store derivable data in state, and there are complex dependencies between multiple stores (e.g., WizardStateProvider depends on both wizardStore and uiStore).
- **Impact**: Increases the risk of state synchronization issues and makes the data flow harder to understand.
- **Fix**: Compute derivable data on-the-fly rather than storing it in state, and consider implementing a facade pattern or context to simplify component access to multiple stores.

### ðŸŸ  Performance Optimization Opportunities

- **Finding**: Several components lack memoization for expensive calculations or callbacks, and some may cause unnecessary re-renders due to inline function definitions.
- **Impact**: May lead to performance issues, especially on lower-end mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Implement `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive calculations and callbacks, and ensure components only re-render when necessary.

### ðŸŸ¡ Abstraction Leaks in Service Layer

- **Finding**: The service layer has inconsistent abstraction levels, with some services exposing direct Firestore operations while others abstract them completely.
- **Impact**: Makes the services harder to use correctly and increases coupling between the application and Firebase.
- **Fix**: Standardize the service API pattern across all services, preferably with full abstraction of Firestore operations.

### ðŸŸ¡ Missing Documentation

- **Finding**: While some files have comprehensive JSDoc comments, many lack proper documentation for functions, components, and interfaces.
- **Impact**: Makes it harder for new developers to understand the codebase and use components correctly.
- **Fix**: Add consistent JSDoc comments to all components, functions, and interfaces, with examples where appropriate.

### ðŸŸ¢ Effective TypeScript Usage

- **Finding**: The project generally uses TypeScript effectively to define data models and ensure type safety across components, particularly in the service layer.
- **Impact**: Reduces the potential for runtime errors and provides better developer experience.
- **Recommendation**: Continue this pattern and consider adding more comprehensive JSDoc comments to complex types.

### ðŸŸ¢ Well-Structured Form Components

- **Finding**: Form components like `TextField.client.tsx` are well-structured with proper accessibility attributes, error handling, and validation.
- **Impact**: Provides a solid foundation for form implementation with good user experience.
- **Recommendation**: Extend this pattern to all form components and ensure consistent implementation across the application.

## Gap Analysis

### Incomplete Features

#### ðŸŸ  Admin Dashboard Implementation

- **Original Finding**: The Admin Dashboard page contained multiple TODO comments and placeholder components. While the dashboard store was well-structured with comprehensive type definitions, the actual UI implementation was incomplete.
- **Impact**: Administrators lacked a functional dashboard for monitoring system status and accessing key metrics.
- **Resolution**: Implemented a comprehensive dashboard service layer and updated all card components to use the service instead of mock data. Created a fully functional dashboard with metrics, charts, tables, status monitoring, and activity logs.
- **Date Resolved**: March 2025

#### ðŸŸ  Missing Testing Implementation

- **Finding**: Despite having a comprehensive TESTING-STRATEGY.md document, there are no actual test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts) in the codebase.
- **Impact**: Lack of automated tests increases the risk of regressions and makes it harder to validate business logic.
- **Fix**: Implement unit tests for critical utility functions, integration tests for key user flows, and end-to-end tests for primary features as outlined in the testing strategy document.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Incomplete Offline Functionality

- **Finding**: While the application detects offline status and persists data locally, it lacks comprehensive offline functionality such as queued operations that sync when connectivity is restored.
- **Impact**: Users may be unable to perform certain operations when offline, leading to a degraded experience in low-connectivity environments.
- **Fix**: Implement a more robust offline strategy with queued operations and proper synchronization when connectivity is restored.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Limited Haptic Feedback Implementation

- **Finding**: While haptic feedback is defined as a feature flag (`HAPTIC_FEEDBACK: true`), no actual implementation of vibration/haptic feedback was found in the codebase.
- **Impact**: Mobile users miss out on tactile feedback that would enhance the user experience.
- **Fix**: Implement the `navigator.vibrate()` API in interactive components like counters, buttons, and bottom sheets.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Incomplete Swipe Navigation

- **Finding**: While swipe navigation is defined as a feature flag (`SWIPE_NAVIGATION: true`), implementation appears to be limited or missing in key areas like the Categories step.
- **Impact**: Mobile users have a less intuitive navigation experience in certain parts of the application.
- **Fix**: Fully implement swipe navigation for the Categories step and other appropriate areas of the application.

### Technical Debt

#### ðŸŸ  Placeholder Component Implementations

- **Finding**: Several common components like `Counter.client.tsx` contain placeholder implementations rather than complete functionality.
- **Impact**: These components may not be fully functional or accessible in the application, leading to inconsistent user experience.
- **Fix**: Complete the implementation of these components with proper styling, accessibility attributes, and functionality.
- **Progress**: The `loading-spinner.tsx` component has been fully implemented with proper styling, accessibility attributes, and multiple variants (March 2025).

#### ðŸŸ¡ Inconsistent Component Naming and Organization

- **Finding**: The project has inconsistent casing in component filenames and organization patterns, with some components using PascalCase and others using kebab-case.
- **Impact**: Makes file location less predictable and violates the documented naming convention.
- **Fix**: Standardize all component filenames and organization according to the established convention in the component guidelines.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Redundant Constants and Logic

- **Finding**: The wizard state management is spread across multiple files with some duplication of logic. Category definitions appear in both the `CategoriesStep.client.tsx` component and the wizard store.
- **Impact**: Makes it harder to maintain and extend functionality, as changes need to be made in multiple places.
- **Fix**: Consolidate duplicated logic into shared utilities or hooks, and maintain single sources of truth for constants and configurations.

#### ðŸŸ  Missing Focus Management for Accessibility

- **Finding**: The application lacks comprehensive focus management for modal dialogs and wizard steps.
- **Impact**: Makes it harder for keyboard users to navigate the application and may violate WCAG 2.2 compliance requirements.
- **Fix**: Implement proper focus management for all modal dialogs and ensure focus is properly managed during wizard step transitions.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Inconsistent Error Handling
