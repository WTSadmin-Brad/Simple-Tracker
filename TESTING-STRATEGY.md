# Simple Tracker Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our testing approach for the Simple Tracker application, tailored specifically for AI-assisted development. Our strategy focuses on ensuring code quality and user experience while leveraging the strengths of AI pair programming.

## Testing Philosophy

Given our development approach using an AI IDE to quickly generate code, we'll adopt a pragmatic testing strategy that:

1. **Prioritizes critical paths** - Focus testing efforts on core user journeys
2. **Balances coverage with velocity** - Avoid over-testing simple components
3. **Emphasizes integration points** - Pay special attention to component interactions
4. **Validates business rules** - Ensure all business logic is properly tested
5. **Maintains accessibility** - Verify that the application meets accessibility standards

## Testing Layers

### 1. Static Analysis

- **TypeScript Type Checking**
  - Leverage TypeScript's static type system to catch type errors early
  - Maintain strict type checking configuration
  - Use proper type definitions for all components and functions

- **ESLint & Prettier**
  - Enforce code style and best practices
  - Run linting as part of the development workflow
  - Configure rules to match project requirements

- **Component Props Validation**
  - Use proper prop types and validation
  - Document component interfaces thoroughly
  - Validate required props and provide sensible defaults

### 2. Unit Testing

- **Focus Areas**
  - Utility functions in `/src/lib/`
  - Helper functions and custom hooks
  - Complex business logic and calculations
  - Form validation rules and schemas

- **Testing Tools**
  - Jest for test runner and assertions
  - React Testing Library for component testing
  - MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

- **Coverage Goals**
  - 80%+ coverage for utility functions
  - 70%+ coverage for business logic components
  - Lower coverage acceptable for simple UI components

### 3. Component Testing

- **Approach**
  - Test components in isolation with mocked dependencies
  - Focus on component behavior rather than implementation details
  - Verify component renders correctly with different props
  - Test user interactions and state changes

- **Priority Components**
  - Form field components
  - Wizard steps
  - Calendar components
  - Bottom sheets

- **Accessibility Testing**
  - Test keyboard navigation
  - Verify screen reader compatibility
  - Test with reduced motion preferences
  - Ensure proper color contrast

### 4. Integration Testing

- **Key Integration Points**
  - Wizard flow between steps
  - Form submission and API integration
  - State management across components
  - Calendar interactions with day detail sheet

- **Testing Approach**
  - Mock API responses for predictable testing
  - Test complete user flows
  - Verify state updates correctly propagate
  - Test error handling and edge cases

### 5. End-to-End Testing

- **Core User Journeys**
  - Employee ticket submission workflow
  - Calendar navigation and workday management
  - Admin dashboard interactions
  - Authentication flows

- **Tools**
  - Playwright for cross-browser testing
  - Mobile device emulation for responsive testing
  - Visual regression testing for UI changes

- **Testing Frequency**
  - Run E2E tests before major releases
  - Automate critical path tests for continuous integration
  - Manual exploratory testing for complex interactions

## Testing Workflow

### During Development

1. **Component Development**
   - Write component with clear interface
   - Add basic tests for functionality
   - Verify accessibility requirements

2. **Feature Integration**
   - Test integration with other components
   - Verify state management works correctly
   - Test edge cases and error handling

3. **Code Review**
   - Ensure tests cover critical functionality
   - Verify test quality and readability
   - Check for accessibility compliance

### Continuous Integration

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Run linting and type checking
   - Run affected unit tests
   - Format code automatically

2. **CI Pipeline**
   - Run all unit and integration tests
   - Check code coverage
   - Run accessibility checks
   - Perform bundle size analysis

3. **Pre-release Testing**
   - Run end-to-end tests
   - Perform manual testing on mobile devices
   - Verify critical user journeys

## Test Organization

- **Test Files Location**
  - Co-locate tests with implementation files
  - Use `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx` suffix
  - Group test utilities in `/src/test-utils/`

- **Test Data**
  - Create reusable test fixtures
  - Store mock data in `/src/test-utils/mocks/`
  - Use factories for generating test data

- **Test Documentation**
  - Document test coverage goals
  - Maintain testing guidelines
  - Document known limitations or exclusions

## Specific Testing Considerations

### Wizard Testing

- Test validation rules for each step
- Verify navigation between steps works correctly
- Test session recovery functionality
- Verify form submission and error handling

### Calendar Testing

- Test date calculations and display logic
- Verify month navigation and day selection
- Test workday type changes and validation
- Verify ticket indicators display correctly

### Animation Testing

- Test animations respect reduced motion preferences
- Verify transitions between states work correctly
- Test interactive elements provide proper feedback

### Mobile Testing

- Verify touch interactions work as expected
- Test responsive layouts across device sizes
- Verify bottom sheets and mobile navigation
- Test with various device orientations

## Conclusion

This testing strategy is designed to balance thorough testing with development velocity, focusing on critical paths and user experiences while leveraging the strengths of AI-assisted development. By following this approach, we'll ensure the Simple Tracker application is reliable, accessible, and provides a great user experience.
