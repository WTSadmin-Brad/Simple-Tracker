# Placeholder Files Inventory

This document catalogs all identified placeholder files in the Simple Tracker codebase, categorized by their current state and recommended action.

## Identification Methodology

Files were identified as placeholders through:
1. Explicit placeholder comments in the code
2. Minimal/stub implementations
3. References in the CHANGELOG.md as incomplete components 
4. Components mentioned as placeholders in project documentation
5. Code containing TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation

   */
  const submitTicket = useCallback(async (wizardData: WizardData) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    
    try {
      // TODO: Implement API call to submit ticket
      // Return mock data for placeholder
      return {} as Ticket;
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to submit ticket');
      return null;
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);

## Prioritized Implementation Plan

Based on the inventory, the following prioritized implementation plan is recommended:

### Critical Priority (Security & Core Functionality)
1. ✅ Create Next.js middleware for server-side route protection
2. ✅ Complete error handling in the API services with structured error objects
3. ✅ Implement network failure handling with retry mechanisms

### High Priority (User Experience & Accessibility)
1. Complete API client functions in useTickets.ts
2. Integrate the admin dashboard with actual API data instead of mock data

### Medium Priority (Enhancement & Consistency)
1. Add proper type definitions to all components
2. Standardize auto-save feedback mechanism
3. Ensure consistent focus management for accessibility

### Low Priority (Optimization & Polish)
1. Implement haptic feedback for mobile
2. Add optimistic updates for common operations
3. Enhance offline functionality with queued operations

## Next Steps

For each remaining placeholder component, the implementation approach should include:

1. Requirements gathering from similar components and design documents
2. Implementing proper styling aligned with the design system
3. Adding comprehensive accessibility features
4. Ensuring proper error handling and loading states
5. Adding TypeScript type definitions
6. Writing tests
7. Updating documentation

This inventory provides a roadmap for systematically addressing all placeholder implementations in the codebase, with a focus on prioritizing critical functionality first, followed by user experience enhancements and optimizations.
