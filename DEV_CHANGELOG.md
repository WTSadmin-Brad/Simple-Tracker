### Key Implementation Decisions

- The directory structure document has been updated to reflect our dynamic routing approach
- API routes use a pattern where a single dynamic route handler processes different types/actions through a switch statement
- Component organization follows a strict layering pattern with clear responsibilities
- Client components use `.client.tsx` suffix, server components use `.tsx` (no suffix)
- The app does NOT require offline functionality - all features assume connectivity

### Component Organization Strategy

We're following a layered approach:

1. UI Primitives (`/src/components/ui/`)
2. Common Elements (`/src/components/common/`)
3. Feature Components (`/src/components/feature/`)
4. Route-Specific Components (`/src/app/*/_components/`)

Client components use the `.client.tsx` suffix, while server components use `.tsx`.

### Important Implementation Details

- **Dynamic Routing Pattern**: Using Next.js App Router dynamic routes with switch statements to handle different types/steps
- **Wizard State Management**: Using Zustand with localStorage persistence and 24-hour expiration for abandoned sessions
- **Animation System**: Using Framer Motion with spring physics and respecting reduced motion preferences
- **Color System for Counters**:
  - Red(0) → Yellow(1-84) → Green(85-124) → Gold(125-150)
- **Mobile Optimization**:
  - Bottom sheets for selection interfaces
  - Touch targets minimum 44×44px (using `.touch-target` class)
  - Swipe navigation for Categories step
- **Session Recovery**: Implemented prompt to recover abandoned sessions with clear timestamps
