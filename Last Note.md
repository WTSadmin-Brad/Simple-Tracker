# Image Upload Flow Implementation - Summary

I've successfully implemented the centralized image service and updated the components to use it for a more streamlined image upload flow. Here's a summary of the changes:

## 1. Created a Centralized Image Service (`image-service.ts`)

The new image service provides:

- **Consistent handling**: A single source of truth for image operations
- **Memory management**: Proper tracking and cleanup of object URLs
- **Progress tracking**: Detailed upload progress information
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Validation**: Consistent image validation rules

## 2. Created a React Hook for Easy Integration (`useImageUpload.ts`)

The hook provides:

- **React-friendly interface**: State management for uploads in React components
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress updates
- **Error handling**: Component-level error management
- **Callbacks**: Event hooks for different stages of upload
- **Multiple file support**: Ability to handle single or multiple file uploads

## 3. Updated Components

### Image Upload Step Component

- **Simplified state management**: Delegated complex operations to the service
- **Better progress feedback**: Added progress indicators
- **Enhanced error handling**: Clear error messages and recovery options
- **Improved memory management**: Proper cleanup of resources

### Image Upload Field Component

- **Streamlined upload process**: Simplified component code
- **Consistent validation**: Used service for validation
- **Enhanced visual feedback**: Better loading and progress indicators
- **Improved error handling**: Clearer error messages

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Simplified Code**: Components focus on UI while delegating complex logic to the service
2. **Better User Experience**: More responsive feedback during uploads
3. **Reliability**: More robust error handling and recovery
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and extend functionality
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Proper resource management
6. **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all image upload interfaces

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the implementation across different devices
2. **Documentation**: Add comments explaining the usage of the image service
3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhance error recovery mechanisms if needed
4. **User Experience Refinements**: Based on feedback, refine the visual feedback
