# Basic Plan with AI-Optimized Prompts

Here's a step-by-step plan with AI-optimized prompts for each phase. I've structured the prompts to be clear, focused, and broken into manageable chunks to prevent errors.

## Phase a: Admin Dashboard Implementation

### Step 1: Analyze Admin Dashboard Structure

```
Analyze the admin dashboard implementation:
1. Identify which components are placeholders vs. completed
2. Examine the dashboard store structure
3. Determine what data integration is missing
4. Review the card component architecture

Don't make changes yet, just analyze.
```

### Step 2: Implement Dashboard Card Components (First Batch)

```
Complete the implementation of the following dashboard card components:
1. [List 2-3 specific card components]

For each component:
1. Replace mock data with actual API integration
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add loading states
4. Ensure responsive behavior

Focus only on these specific components for now.
```

## Phase 4: Update Documentation

### Step 1: Update CHANGELOG.md

```
Update the CHANGELOG.md file to reflect our completed changes:
1. Mark the following items as completed:
   - [List specific items we've addressed]
2. Add notes about implementation details where relevant
3. Don't remove any entries, just update their status

Only update entries for work we've actually completed.
```

### Step 2: Update ACTION-PLAN.md

```
Update the ACTION-PLAN.md file to reflect our progress:
1. Mark completed items in the plan
2. Adjust priorities based on what we've learned during implementation
3. Add any new action items discovered during our work
4. Update the implementation approach section if needed

Make sure the plan remains aligned with our actual development approach.
```

## Tips for Working with AI on This Project

1. **Always verify directory and file names** before implementation - AI may hallucinate filenames
2. **Request specific output formats** for better clarity (markdown tables, bullet lists)
3. **Break large tasks into smaller chunks** to maintain accuracy
4. **Ask for verification steps** after implementations to catch errors
5. **Keep context focused** on the current task rather than the entire project at once
6. **Request "thinking out loud"** when AI is making complex decisions about architecture
7. **Have AI draft tests** for components it implements to verify functionality

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular phase or create more detailed prompts for a specific task?
