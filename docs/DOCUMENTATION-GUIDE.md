## Overview

This guide outlines the approach, standards, and processes for maintaining documentation in the Simple Tracker project. Following the "Docs as Code" methodology, we treat documentation as a first-class citizen alongside our codebase, ensuring it remains accurate, useful, and up-to-date.

## Docs as Code Approach

The Simple Tracker project follows a "Docs as Code" approach with the following principles:

1. **Version Control**: All documentation is stored in the same Git repository as the code
2. **Review Process**: Documentation changes follow the same pull request and review process as code changes
3. **Markdown Format**: Documentation is written in Markdown for consistency and ease of use
4. **Continuous Updates**: Documentation is updated alongside code changes
5. **Automated Checks**: Documentation quality and consistency are verified through automated tools

### Key Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: Documentation and code are always in sync
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple team members can contribute to documentation
- **Version History**: Changes to documentation are tracked over time
- **Integrated Workflow**: Documentation becomes a natural part of the development process

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming

- Use `KEBAB-CASE.md` for documentation file names
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content
- Group related documentation in subdirectories

### Markdown Style

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` for h1, `##` for h2, etc.)
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 100 lines
- Use code blocks with language specifiers for code examples
- Use relative links for internal references
- Use descriptive link text instead of URLs

### Content Structure

- Start each document with a clear title and brief overview
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (h1 for title, h2 for main sections, etc.)
- Include examples and code snippets where applicable
- Use tables for structured data
- Use lists for sequential steps or collections of related items

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in present tense
- Use active voice
- Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
- Use consistent terminology throughout all documentation

## Automation and CI/CD Integration

### Documentation CI Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following documentation-related checks:

1. **Markdown Linting**: Ensures consistent formatting and style
2. **Link Validation**: Checks for broken internal and external links
3. **Spell Checking**: Identifies spelling errors and typos
4. **Documentation Coverage**: Verifies that new code has corresponding documentation

### Automated Documentation Generation

We use the following tools to automate documentation generation:

1. **TypeDoc**: Generates API documentation from TypeScript code
2. **Storybook**: Generates component documentation with interactive examples
3. **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Generates API endpoint documentation
4. **Mermaid**: Generates diagrams from text descriptions

### Integration with Pull Requests

Documentation is integrated into our pull request process:

1. **Documentation Requirement**: PRs that change code must include corresponding documentation updates
2. **Documentation Preview**: Automated preview of documentation changes in PR comments
3. **Documentation Checklist**: PR template includes a documentation checklist
4. **Documentation Review**: Documentation changes are reviewed alongside code changes

## AI-Assisted Documentation

We leverage AI tools to assist with documentation:

### AI Documentation Tools

1. **GitHub Copilot**: Assists with generating and updating documentation
2. **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generates summaries of code changes for documentation
3. **Documentation Quality Checks**: AI-powered suggestions for improving clarity and completeness
4. **Automated Docstring Generation**: Generates and updates code comments and docstrings

### AI Usage Guidelines

1. **Human Review**: All AI-generated content must be reviewed by a human
2. **Consistency Check**: Ensure AI-generated content follows our documentation standards
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Verify that AI-generated content is technically accurate
4. **Context Awareness**: Provide sufficient context when using AI tools

## Documentation Review Process

### Review Checklist

When reviewing documentation changes, consider the following:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Is the information correct and up-to-date?
2. **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary aspects of the topic?
